# tango_with_django_code
This repository code is for IT coursework in UofG

The code exercises of each chapter are basically divided into two commits (Chapter 3 to Chapter 10)

Basically, after writing the code exercises for each chapter, I commit it for the first time
After passing the test specified in each chapter, I commit it for the second time (sometimes there is also a third commit)

You can find the exercise code for each chapter by the commit record
